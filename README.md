Simple app which shows a customisable list of images in daydream mode.

It takes a URL in its settings dialog and then fetches this URL every time the
daydream mode activates. The result should be a list of URLs to images, one per
line, that will then be shown in slideshow mode.

The display and fade durations are currently hardcoded ressources.
